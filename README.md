# Customer_churn_Prediction_using_Deep_Learning
The goal of this project is to predict customer churn, i.e., whether a customer will exit (churn) or remain with the company, based on various attributes such as credit score, age, tenure, balance, number of products, etc. This is a binary classification problem with "Exited" as the target variable.
